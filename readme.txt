

This code is a beta version of Matlab implementation of the saliency algorithm

Thanks to J. van de Weijer, Th. Gevers, J-M Geusebroek "Boosting Color Saliency in Image Feature Detection"
(PAMI06), for providing the salient points detector.

Thanks to C. Grant and Stephen P. Boyd. for providing the "cvx" toolbox.

Thanks to Ehsan Elhamifar, Rene Vidal "Sparse Subspace Clustering" (CVPR09)
for providing the SSC clustering matlab code


Matlab script file to start:
  runsaliency.m: run the saliency measure
 (note that you have download the SLIC superpixel software to get the 'dat' file of your own picture)
